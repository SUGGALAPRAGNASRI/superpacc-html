     <h5>The department of civil Engineering was established in the year 2008 with an intake of 60. Nine batches of students nearly 600 have successfully completed their graduation so far from the department. Our strength is our faculty. We have twelve faculty members and five supporting staff members.
         <BR><BR>The average experience of the faculty in the department is 13 years. The department has eight physical laboratories viz., Concrete laboratory, Transportation Engineering laboratory, Geotechnical Engineering Laboratory, Environmental Engineering laboratory, Survey laboratory, Geology Laboratory, Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory, Computer aided design Laboratory. All laboratories are equipped with state of the art equipment to suit the needs of academia and industry.
            <BR><BR>The department is maintaining good rapport with surrounding industries and governmental agencies to support the students in carrying their summer internship for one month duration. The students are prepared with multi-dimensional skill sets covering all the required graduate attributes. More focus is given on practical learning, projects, and research. The department is arranging guest lectures from industry personnel, industrial visits and tours every year to fill the gap between academia and industry. The department is also conducting workshops and conferences at regular intervals in the latest and innovative areas of civil engineering. The board of studies of civil engineering is constituted by taking the services of professors from premier institutions like IIT’s, NIT’s and Industry personnel.
                <BR><BR>The department is offering consultancy services in the areas of structural designs, third party proof checking of structural designs and testing of materials for quality. Many students got placements in civil engineering core companies and IT companies. Some of the students are pursuing their post graduation in reputed institutions in India and abroad in every batch.
