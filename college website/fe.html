        The Freshman Engineering Department has 27 highly experienced faculty members who enable students to develop a strong base of fundamental knowledge with values to mould themselves into future technocrats of great worth. The Department has 8 faculty members in Mathematics, 5 in Physics, 5 in Chemistry, 7 in English, 2 in Environmental Studies and 3 technicians in labs. Staff members have research inclination and varied teaching experience. So far 10 members have been awarded Ph.D and 12 memebers are persuing Ph.D., 15 members have been awarded M.Phil.
        <br><br>Life Sciences for Engineering lab enlighten students to observe and understand instruments like Microscopy, spectrophotometer, calorimeter, centrifuge and apply to develop new models, the observations in quantitative analysis like estimation of proteins, enzymes and nitrates led to sizable adoptions in the volume of available information. As well as nature of information on gene transmission and mapping expands to analyze an automated process.
        <br><br>Communicative English Lab has state-of-the-art equipment like 65 computer systems along with updated K-Van software and Audio-visual system. It facilitates students to hone both communication skills and employability skills.
