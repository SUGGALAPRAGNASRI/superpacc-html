     <h5>M.Tech Machine Design started in the year 2008 with an annual intake of 18 seats. Machine dynamics lab was specially established worth of 8 lakhs. Department also purchased robotics software and hard ware for the benefit of students and staff. Machine design forms a core branch in the domain of Mechanical engineering and its allied streams. Machine design incorporates the process by which resources are connected into useful mechanical forms or Mechanisms so as to obtain useful output from the machines in the desired forms as per the requirements. Machine design leads to formation of an entirely new machine. Machine design is a composite application of mathematics, kinematics, Statics and dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, material science and engineering and also engineering drawing. The PG course empowers the student to efficiently address the practical design problems by subjecting the students to advanced courses in the domain of Machine design.
